FROM THE HINDU, VISA CONSULATE GENERAL:
Good question about visa rejections. Although the vast majority of visa applicants receive their visas and go on to study in the U.S., some don’t. The main reasons for not getting the visa include the inability to finance the education; the inability to convince the interviewing officer that they will be able to complete their course of studies; and the inability to explain their educational goals and plans. It is important to be able to explain your own story in your own words, not say something that is or sounds scripted.


Is it necessary to show a certain minimum bank balance when applying for visa?
A: Student visa applicants need to be able to show they have the financial resources to be able to pay for their studies in the United States. Financial resources can include help from family, personal savings, education loans, scholarships, or other assets. Visa officers may not look at documents applicants bring with them to the visa interview but you may be asked to summarize your financial situation orally. 


Proving I will not stay in USA: http://www.immigratetoamerica.org/how-to-show-strong-ties-to-home-country-while-getting-a-visa/
During the conversation she asked future plans non-chalantly, I replied a PhD since I want to return back to become a professor in the IIT's.


FROM THE HINDU, VISA CONSULATE GENERAL:
If the parents and siblings of a student are settled in India with good immovable assets like land and house, can it be a sufficient reason to prove that the student has strong roots to come back to India?
A: For student visa applicants, the main issues are: does the student really plan to study in the U.S. and does he or she have the financial resources to pay for the study. Financial resources can include help from family, education loans and scholarships. Student applicants will need to show the visa officer they are serious about studying in the U.S. Family ties in India are more important for a visitor visa than a student visa.
