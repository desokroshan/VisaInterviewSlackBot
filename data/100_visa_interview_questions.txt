1. Why this university?
Ans. Sir, the first and foremost factor for selecting this university was the amount of quality research going on there in the field of Computer Science and Softw Engg. I came to know that my research interest matches with that of the faculty there. Hence, I want to be a part their research group and learn more. The main goal of the research there is to develop and investigate end-user software engineering technologies for enabling End Users to Shape Effective Software. Besides this, the University has its own Laboratory for Empirical Software Testing Research where students study software testing techniques by empirical means. There is also an Usability Testing Facility which is used as a testbed for systematically evaluating the usability and robustness of software tools and interfaces, across a range of common desktop platforms. Above
all, the courses being offered there are designed in such a way that they are more research oriented. Specialization in Softw Engg @ xxxxxx University is highly reputed and its ranked 5 worldwide for Softw Engg specialization.

2. Why do you plan to do MS? Why MS in CS ?
Ans. Having worked for 2 years in an IT company I learnt a lot about software development and I have a good know-how of Computer Science and Software Engg, but a bit more technical knowledge and research in the field will serve greatly when I come back here and join the company of my choice. Higher qualifications give a better place, a better standard in today's competitive world. I have seen that there is a dearth of persons with greater technical know-how in this field, and whosoever has it will be benefitted highly. So I wish to complete my MS and strengthen my knowledge and grasp the opportunity.
3. Why do you wish to study in the US ?
Ans. US grad Schools are way ahead in research in fields like Computer science and Software Engg. when compared to other countries of the world. They also have advanced courses like ####, %%%% and ***** which is absent in Indian Universities. Moreover, they stress on practical knowledge & not just book learning. A degree from US is globally recognized as the academic standards are very high there. USA is the mecca of education.
4. Why Don't you study in India ?
(This is the same question as the second but you can answer it in a different way. Any one qn. will be asked. If 3rd q is asked, stress on + points of US schools and if why not India is asked,show the negative side of Indian Universities. In both the cases you have to show the plus points of US Universities with compared to Indian Universities)
Ans. Masters Education in India lays more emphasis on the theory part rather than the practical, Hence a Masters degree from India does not really help in fulfilling the career goals of a person like me. Indian Universities do not have enough facilities to support students in their research, whereas US Universities have sound infrastructure to support students to gain both the theoretical as well as practical knowledge. Moreover, the courses in India are not flexible as in us

5. Why MS in CS with Softw Engg as specialization ?
Ans. The number of end-user programmers in the world will soon number 20 times as many as the number of professional programmers. Current research is primarily focused in helping with the dependability of the software the end users create and customize. Towards this goal, researchers in xxxxxx University are working on ways to enable systems to collaborate with these users, in a software development paradigm that blends traditionally separate functions -- specification, design, implementation, component integration, debugging, testing, and maintenance -- into tightly integrated, highly interactive environments that work together with users to continually improve dependability.
6. Which was your undergraduate college?
Ans. I did my Bachelors of Engineering in ****** which is affiliated to #### University.

12. What was your bachelor's degree in?
Ans. I completed my Bachelors of Engineering in ^&%^&%.
13. Why did you switch fields from Electrical and Electronics to Computer Science ? Why are you changing your stream?
Ans. During my college days, apart from my coursework in college I learnt computer languages out of my own interest. In the process I completed courses in C, C++, JAVA, J2EE. I became a Sun certified Java Programmer during my 3rd year. The additional interest that I had for Comp Science also made me take up a job as a Software Engineer. I became well trained and gained valuable industry experience during my job. But, I always had it in my mind, that once I strengthen myself in my field, I will go on to enhance my skills in the field of Computers and Software Engg. Hence I chose to pursue my masters in Computer Science.
14. What is the purpose of your trip?
